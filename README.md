## 🎯 What is ThinkMesh?

ThinkMesh connects **problem solvers** with **real problems** in their communities and around the world.

**How it works:**
1. 🔍 **Problems are posted** (from trending topics or community submissions)
2. 💡 **You submit solutions** (judged by quality, not popularity)
3. 🏆 **Winners earn tokens** (crypto rewards on Base blockchain)
4. 🛠️ **Solutions get implemented** (open-source bounties, hackathons)
5. 📊 **Impact is tracked** (on-chain proof of real-world change)

Think: **"Gitcoin meets Stack Overflow for real-world problems"**
